# To-Do List JavaScript
JavaScript To-Do List Web

This webpage has designed to help users keep track of their to-do tasks and have better organizing and planning of projects. The user could create new projects and any number of assignments. Once the user has completed one of them, the user has the option to mark it and will be to another section on the webpage. Plus, the user can delete or edit any task if it's required.

> This repo includes the code for the JavaScript To-Do List. Github users could download the code and use it to generate a new web-page with new properties as the user could want.
